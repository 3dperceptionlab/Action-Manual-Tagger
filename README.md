# Action-Manual-Tagger
This is a Qt project that makes possible the tagging of videos/images/bvh animations. You can assign each frame what behaviour, action or subaction is being made. Laterly, after the tagging, itÂ´s possible to export it to a JSON format and import it for deep learning purposes.

Moreover, it supports a video data augmentation as extension to the tool in case if it exists a lack of data. The possible operations that can be applied are: operations at image level(change brightness, contrast, blurring, cropping, translation..etc) and operations at video level as duplicating randomly the frames
