# Action-Manual-Tagger
This is a Qt project that makes possible the tagging of videos/images/bvh animations. You can assign each frame what behaviour, action or subaction is being made. Laterly, after the tagging, itÂ´s possible to export it to a JSON format and import it for deep learning purposes.
