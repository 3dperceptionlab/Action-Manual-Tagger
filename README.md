# Action-Manual-Tagger
This is a Qt project that makes possible to give a frame annotation level, reporting in each frame which behaviour, action and subaction is happening. As result, a behaviour analysis dataset is obtained. This information can be used to train Deep Learning or classical oriented algorithm.

Moreover, it supports a video data augmentation as extension to the tool in case if it exists a lack of data. The possible operations that can be applied are: operations at image level(change brightness, contrast, blurring, cropping, translation..etc) and operations at video level as duplicating randomly the frames
